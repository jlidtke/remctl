 * Portability wrapper around systemd-daemon headers.

 * Currently, only sd_listen_fds and sd_notify are guaranteed to be provided
 * by this interface.  This takes the approach of stubbing out these functions
 * if the libsystemd-daemon library is not available, rather than providing a
 * local implementation, on the grounds that anyone who wants systemd status
 * reporting should be able to build with the systemd libraries.
